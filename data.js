   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is a front-end-only "CMS". There is no server and no database —
   everything is persisted in the browser via localStorage. It exists to
   demonstrate a complete content-management workflow (auth, CRUD,
   drafts, scheduling, media, categories, tags) entirely on the client,
   which is the honest constraint of a static portfolio deliverable.

   To turn this into a real product, this file is the seam: swap the
   body of every CMS.* function for a fetch() call to a real API and
   nothing in index.html or admin.html needs to change.

It isn't. You will miss trains. You will miss the one you thought was the only one. And somehow you'll still arrive somewhere worth arriving at, just later, and by a route nobody would have recommended.</p><p>You are so afraid of being ordinary that you can't yet see how much tenderness is hiding inside an ordinary life. The dishes in the sink. The friend who calls on a Tuesday for no reason. These will matter more than the things you're currently losing sleep over — I promise you this the way you can only promise something after you've already lived past it.</p><p>There is a particular kind of loneliness you're carrying right now that feels like evidence of something being wrong with you. It isn't. It's just what it feels like to be a person who notices too much and says too little. That noticing, eventually, becomes the thing people love you for. Be patient with it.</p><p>You will hurt people without meaning to, and you will be hurt in ways you didn't see coming. Neither will be the end of the story you think it is. Both will be folded, eventually, into a life that has room for all of it — the mistakes, the almosts, the ones that got away and the one who didn't.</p><p>I'm not writing to warn you. I'm writing because I finally understand what my mother must have felt at my age, holding a version of me that hadn't happened yet, and I wanted, just once, to hold you the same way — without trying to fix you, just glad you're going to make it.</p>",

I want to tell you something true instead of something tidy.</p><p>The truth is I miss you in ways that don't fit into a message. I miss the specific quality of laughing with you in a kitchen that wasn't either of ours. Distance doesn't erase that knowing, but it does let it go quiet, and the quiet unsettles me more than I expected.</p><p>I used to think that if a friendship required effort, something was wrong with it. Now I think that's backwards. The ones worth keeping require effort precisely because they're worth keeping — the way you water something you actually want to survive the winter.</p><p>So this isn't an apology for the weeks we don't talk.
